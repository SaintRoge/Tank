# Tank 

It's a sfml based game.

You only need SFML lib (2.4.1 : http://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.4.1-linux-gcc-64-bit.tar.gz) if you don't make install.

```sh
$ make all #To build
$ make install #To install 
$ make remove #To desinstall the app
$ make reinstall #To reinstall
$ make mrproper #To rebuild
$ make clean #To remove useless files 
$ make run #To make and run
$ make pro #To make, clean and run
$ make zpro #To make install, clean and run
$ make one #To build and use one time 
```
Just install build-essential, libsfml-dev.
